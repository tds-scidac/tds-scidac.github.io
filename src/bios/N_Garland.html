 <a href="https://ngarland.info/research"><b>Nathan Garland</b></a> is a lecturer in Applied Mathematics and Physics at Griffith University, Australia. Prior to joining Griffith, Nathan was a post-doctoral researcher in T-Division at LANL. His areas of research interest are based around computational modelling of plasmas in various applications, and the integration of high-quality atomic input data into plasma modelling frameworks. His research has explored applications including the modeling of low-temperature plasmas and electron transport in liquid discharges, tokamak fusion plasmas, collisional-radiative modelling, deep-learning in plasma modelling, and scattering data and physics of electrons, positrons, muons with atoms and molecules.
