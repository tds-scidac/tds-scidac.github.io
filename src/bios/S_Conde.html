 <b>Sidafa Conde</b> is a developer for the  Drekar FE resistive MHD code and contributed implicit / explicit (IMEX) time-integration, and adaptive time step control algorithms as well as general FE 
 Software technologies. The general time integration algorithms are delivered in the Trilinos scientific software library.
 Sidafa worked on the TDS project as postdoc, and as an early career senior member of technical staff in the Computational Mathematics Department at Sandia National Laboratories. 
 Sidafa received his PhD in Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. His research interests include: high performance scientific computing,  
 numerical methods for multiple-time-scale nonlinear coupled PDEs, temporal and spatial discretizations of PDEs, applications to computational fluid dynamics, and magnetohydrodynamic systems modeling.
