<b>Michael Lively</b> is a postdoctoral researcher in the Physics and Chemistry of Materials (T-1) group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He received his B.S. (2014) in Nuclear Engineering from Purdue University and his M.S. (2017) and Ph.D (2021) in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Mike's research interests include plasma-material interactions (PMI), radiation transport in materials, and plasma-surface coupling in tokamaks, using a diverse simulations toolkit including molecular dynamics, kinetic Monte Carlo, the PETSc library, and the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code developed at LANL. He is currently working on PMI applications for disruption mitigation, including relativistic electron attenuation by shattered pellet injection.
