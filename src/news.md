Jun 22, 2022 | Congratulations to Mr. Yuzhi Li (VT), Dr. Yanzeng Zhang (LANL), Dr. Nami Li (LLNL), and Prof. Chris McDevitt (Florida), for being selected to give invited talks at 2022 APS/DPP meeting, on the topics of Bohm criterion in plasma sheath, tokamak thermal quench, impact of small edge localized mode dynamics, and runaway electron dynamics in tokamak current quench, respectively
Jun 21, 2022 | Congratulations to TDS member Luis Chacon (LANL) on his [Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award](https://science.osti.gov/lawrence). The EO Lawrence award is DOE’s highest honor for mid-career scientists. He was awarded "for seminal contributions in multiscale algorithms for fluid, kinetic, and hybrid simulation of plasmas, enabling scientific breakthroughs in fast magnetic reconnection and self-organization in magnetic fusion systems, and in reactivity degradation in inertial fusion systems".
Apr 21, 2022 | Romit Maulik (ANL) will start a new position at the [Department of Information Science and Technology at Penn State University](https://ist.psu.edu/) as an Assistant Professor while retaining a joint appointment with the MCS division at ANL. He will continue to work with TDS for the [scientific machine learning thrust](ml.md) such as ML-based collisional radiative surrogates.
Apr 13, 2022 | Johann Rudi (ANL) will start a new position at the [Department of Mathematics at Virginia Tech](https://math.vt.edu/) as an Assistant Professor.  Johann will continue working with the TDS team on the project [PETSc-p4est relativistic Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann solver](https://tds-scidac.github.io/fokkerplanck/).
Apr 11, 2022 | Luis Chacon (LANL) organized two-sessions of presentations at the [2022 Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods](https://easychair.org/smart-program/CM2022/2022-04-04.html) on “Scalable Solvers for Coupled Multiphysics” where a number of TDS and international researchers presented work related to scalable plasma physics solvers. 
Apr 11, 2022 | John Shadid (SNL) co-chairs, along with Luke Olson of U. Illinois, the [2022 Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods](https://easychair.org/smart-program/CM2022/) (CMCIM). CMCIM is widely regarded as one of the premier international conferences on iterative methods. Advanced iterative methods are often critical numerical methods for scalable solution methods.
Apr 4, 2022  | TDS team members attend [Sherwood Fusion Theory Conference](https://www.sherwoodtheory.org/sw2022/index.php). Yuzhi Li (VT) and Yanzeng Zhang (LANL) will give invited talks. Ben Zhu (LLNL) is on the Program Committee and will host an invited session.
Mar 27, 2022 | [TDS website](https://tds-scidac.github.io/) is released.
