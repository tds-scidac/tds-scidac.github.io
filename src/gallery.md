*Poincare plot of the magnetic topology in a Pixie3D simulation over 20,000 Alfven times. The goal of this study is to determine if increasing the density of plasma fuel would result in a more controlled thermal quench. This result visualizes that despite the loss of equilibrium and the onset of stochastity, the central core of the reactor, where the majority of the fuek resides, remains nested.*

*TQ simulations with and w/o mitigation (MGI). MGI stands for Massive Gas Injection. Simulations suggest that MGI could reduce the peak heat load on divertor target and spreads it over a wider wetting area.*

*The 3D structure of the effective magnetic mirror ratio $M_{eff}$ in the presence of open stochastic magnetic fields. The black line shows an example open magnetic field line. Red and blue colors represent regions of magnetic wells ($M_{eff} > 1$) and magnetic hills ($M_{eff} < 1$), respectively. Charged particles can be trapped in the magnetic well region by the magnetic mirror force.*

*The temporal evolution of (left) electron density and (right) electrostatic potential in the presence of open stochastic magnetic fields during the thermal quench. Upper figures show the case where the $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ drift motion is ignored, whereas lower figures show the case where the ExB drift motion is included.*

a free-boundary Grad-Shafranov solver.*

*Unstructured FE hex mesh of ITER plasma domain and solid wall using Cubit. Cubit provides both all hexahedron and tetrahedron capabilities. Capabilities for automatic uniform refinement and parallel portioning are available. As well soon a uniform refinement that snaps the element edges to the geometry will also be available.*

*Schematic diagram of an idealized insertion of a neutral cloud in the core region for disruption mitigation. Inside the separatrix a
high density neutral cloud of Ar ionizes as it expands into a hot (10keV) Deuterium plasma environment.*

*Particle simulation of two-stream instability with three different weight schemes: (left) full-f, (middle) generalized delta-f, and (right) typical delta-f. Upper and lower figures show the motion of electron markers and the evolution of the total electron distribution function in the phase-space ($x-v$), respectively. Whereas the typical delta-f scheme (right) fails after a short time, the newly developed generalized delta-f scheme (middle) successfully simulates the same result as the full-f (left) does.*

*Magnetic topology in excerpt of (1,1) kink simulation without thermal diffusion. As the (1,1) mode grows the core splits and gets expelled while magnetic stochasticity has set in at the outer edge. Towards the end, isolated islands reform but nothing remains from the original core.*

*Magnetic topology in excerpt of (1,1) kink simulation with thermal diffusion. The mode grows and splits the core. Magnetic stochasticity sets in outside the core.<br> The core eventually reheals forming a transport barrier.*
