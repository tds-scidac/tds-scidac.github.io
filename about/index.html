covers a broad range of issues in plasma physics and interdisciplinary
sciences for fusion energy development, including magnetic
confinement fusion (MCF) and inertial confinement fusion (ICF), as
well as the intermediate regime of magneto-inertial confinement fusion
(MIF).  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xianzhu-Tang-2"><b>
His publications to date</b></a> have advanced the theory and physics
understanding of magnetic and plasma self-organization, chaotic mixing
and dynamo, plasma sheath, dust-plasma interaction, plasma-wall
interaction, radiative power exhaust, particle and energy transport in
open field line plasmas, runaway electron dynamics, and plasma physics
effects of self-generated and externally imposed magnetic fields,
inter-species ion diffusion due to thermodynamic cross terms, and
kinetic modification of fusion reactivity in the mix and burn of an
ICF target. His current research focuses on applying advanced

Dr. Shadid received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Minnesota in 1989. John has contributed to the areas of applied math, numerical methods, computational algorithms, and software development, for solution methods of highly-nonlinear coupled multiple-time-scale PDE systems. John was co-PI for the Aztec software library that received a 1997 R&D100 award and was one of the very first scalable parallel iterative solver libraries. He has also been lead-PI for several projects developing robust, scalable, implicit finite element reacting flow, MHD, and multifluid electromagnetic plasma system simulation capabilities in support of DOE Office of Science oriented scientific applications. In 2018, he was elected as a SIAM Fellow and in 2019 he received the United States Association of Computational Mechanics (USACM) Thomas J.R. Hughes Medal for Computational Fluid Mechanics.
