Overview The formation and evolution of runaway electrons (RE) is an intrinsically kinetic process. Despite the importance of RE physics to disruption mitigation, the two way coupling of a kinetic description of REs to the bulk plasma evolution remains an outstanding challenge. The code RunAway Monte carlo (RAMc) was developed to prototype the self-consistent description of a drift kinetic RE solver with an evolving bulk plasma, thus enabling an integrated simulation of all phases of a tokamak disruption. This code employs the exascale computing library Cabana particle simulation toolkit along with PETSc based solvers to enable massively parallel simulation. The use of the drift kinetic formulation employed by RAMc allows for critical elements of RE formation and evolution to be accurately described. Specifically, the solver accurately evaluates the efficiency of RE generation in tokamak geometry across all collisionality regimes Ref. [1] and the phase space evolution of a RE population in the presence of large quantities of injected material Ref. [2] . In addition, by incorporating a collisional radiative model FLYCHK, along with the kinetically evaluated RE current density in a flux diffusion equation, the thermal quench, RE plateau, and a variety of rapid current termination schemes can be self-consistently simulated. Result This integrated solver has recently been employed to describe the phase space evolution of a RE population undergoing a global MHD instability triggered by Deuterium injection. All phases of a tokamak disruption are simulated, beginning with hot tail generation during the thermal quench, the avalanche of the seed RE current, and the formation of a RE plateau. The figure on the left illustrates the current evolution during a simulated disruption, where an MHD instability is triggered by Deuterium injection at t=35 ms resulting in a near complete expulsion of the RE population. While nearly all of the REs are lost, a small remnant seed composed of relativistic trapped electrons is shown to survive the MHD event, and thus allow for a partial reformation of the RE beam via the avalanche mechanism. The second figure indicates the magnitude of the drop of the plasma current that is induced by large scale MHD events as a function of the duration of the instability. It is apparent that only modest drops in the RE current are achieved, even when the flux surfaces remain open for a timescale long compared to the transport timescale associated with the 3D magnetic field.

The above two movies illustratie the momentum space evolution of the RE population during a global MHD instability along with a sample of RE spatial trajectories. The contours in the latter figure indicate the self-consistently evolved poloidal flux surfaces. With regard to the momentum space evolution, after the initial formation of the RE beam, the triggering of an MHD instability results in the loss of nearly all passing REs, thus leading to a near complete termination of the RE current. However, a small population of relativistic trapped electrons remain confined, thus providing a seed population that allows for the partial reformation of the RE beam once the flux surfaces heal if sufficient poloidal flux is available. From the spatial orbits of the REs, the triggering of an MHD instability leads to the near complete expulsion of the RE population. However, once this RE to Ohmic conversion has been effected, the rapid consumption of poloidal flux leads to a strong inductive electric field driving the partial reformation of the RE beam.

Overview The tasks of BOUT++ for Tokamak Disruption Simulation will capitalize on BOUT++ developments and extend its capabilities to evaluate the physics of particle and energy loads on the divertor plates and wall during a disruption. Highlights here will focus on two development fronts. Numerical investigations of edge-plasma response to a thermal quench (TQ) (i.e., intensive particle and energy flux flowing from the core region) with the recently upgraded BOUT++ six-field electromagnetic turbulence modeling. In particular, we use the newly added flux-driven option to mimic the TQ outflux into the pedestal in the simulation. As a start, 1 GW heating power, lasting for 80 microseconds is uniformly applied to the pedestal region ($\\psi \\sim 0.92$) of a typical DIII-D high-confinement (H)-mode plasma that was previously studied for heat-flux width scaling. The total delivered 80 kJ energy is roughly 15% of the stored plasma thermal energy of this DIII-D H-mode discharge. Further developing gyro-Landau-fluid (GLF) models. Tokamak edge plasma spans a large range of collisionality, from the weakly collisional regime in the pedestal to the highly collisional regime in the divertor. This feature both necessitates the implementation of Landau-fluid (LF) operators in edge-plasma fluid codes, such as BOUT++, and also presents new challenges to existing approaches. While kinetic effects are important, significant spatial inhomogeneities and complicated BCs pose significant difficulties for the standard Fourier implementations of LF operators. Under prior LLNL Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding, we developed a \"fast\" configuration-space-based, non-Fourier approach for the application of these operators, which has Fourier-like computational scaling. This approach is based on an approximation of $4/||k||$ by a sum of Lorentzian. The key feature of the approximation is that the Lorentzian can be interpreted as real-space Helmholtz-equation solutions, which can be numerically implemented using highly efficient linear solvers. Both collisionless and collisional LF closure h:q ave been implemented with the existing solvers in BOUT++ by a simple truncation of the infinite sum of Lorentzian. To build on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) science, we apply the ML/deep learning (DL) technique to the fluid-closure problem. This ML work significantly extends the recent success of the machine learned Hammett-Perkins closure to a more sophisticated kinetic LF closure and for the first time implements the machine-learned model closures in a fluid simulation code.

Under prior LLNL Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) funding, we developed a \"fast\" configuration-space-based, non-Fourier approach for the application of these operators, which has Fourier-like computational scaling. This approach is based on an approximation of $4/||k||$ by a sum of Lorentzian. The key feature of the approximation is that the Lorentzian can be interpreted as real-space Helmholtz-equation solutions, which can be numerically implemented using highly efficient linear solvers. Both collisionless and collisional LF closure h:q ave been implemented with the existing solvers in BOUT++ by a simple truncation of the infinite sum of Lorentzian. To build on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) science, we apply the ML/deep learning (DL) technique to the fluid-closure problem. This ML work significantly extends the recent success of the machine learned Hammett-Perkins closure to a more sophisticated kinetic LF closure and for the first time implements the machine-learned model closures in a fluid simulation code.", "title": "Overview"}, {"location": "bout/#result", "text": "(a) Flux surfaces in 2D poloidal plane, and (b) magnetic field-lines in the 3D torus.

An understanding of these constraints is essential for reliable computational studies. Two types of constraints will be discussed in this section. Plasma Steering The constraints on plasma steering as a method for avoiding disruptions are the subject of Reference 1 , which has the abstract: \" Steering tokamak plasmas is commonly viewed as a way to avoid disruptions and runaway electrons. Plasma steering sounds as safe as driving to work but will be shown to more closely resemble driving at high speed through a dense fog on an icy road. The long time required to terminate an ITER discharge compared to time over which dangers can be foreseen is analogous to driving in a dense fog. The difficulty of regaining plasma control if it is lost resembles driving on an icy road. Disruptions and runaways are associated with three issues---a solution to one tends to complicate the solution to the other two: loss of plasma position control, excessive heat deposition, and wall melting due to runaway electrons. All three risks must be addressed for ITER to achieve its mission and essentially eliminated before tokamak power plants can be deployed. \" Magnetic Interaction with the Wall The conducting structures in ITER are greatly simplified in simulations. This can result in an order-of-magnitude error in the force per unit area on structures. For example, the toroidal wall-currents that arise during disruptions that are due to changes in the poloidal field can have their current path rotated into the poloidal direction when wall melting opens a lower inductance path. This increases the $\\vec{j}\\times\\vec{B}$ force by the ratio of the toroidal to the poloidal field---approximately a factor of ten---and the current path can become much narrower, which gives an additional increase in the force density. When wall-currents are induced on a time scale of order 10~ms or less, the dipole moment produced by currents circulating in the individual beryllium tiles can result in strong forces on the tiles. These effects and practical methods for estimating their importance are discussed in 2 . Fast magnetic reconnection during disruptions Tokamak disruptions are associated with a rapid breakup of magnetic surfaces over a large fraction of the plasma volume. The physical effects that allow the breakup of magnetic surfaces are extremely small in the central part of JET and will be even smaller in ITER. Nevertheless, surface breakup occurs many orders of magnitude faster than one would naively think possible. Rapid changes in magnetic topology commonly arise in both laboratory and space settings and are called fast magnetic reconnections. Fast magnetic reconnection is ubiquitous, and the literature is extensive. Unfortunately, the literature grew out of two-dimensional models and ignores what appears to be the dominant effect when the magnetic field depends on all three spatial coordinates. In three dimensions, but not in two, the ratio $\\Delta_{max}/\\Delta_{min}$ between the maximum and minimum separation between two neighboring magnetic field lines at given points in time can become exponentially large on a time scale set by an ideal evolution. When $\\Delta_{min}$ is the scale over which non-ideal effects break field lines, the actual scale over which magnetic field line topology changes is $\\Delta_{max}$--a change in the topology anywhere along a magnetic field line implies a change in topology everywhere along the line. The natural timescale for fast magnetic reconnection is set by the ideal evolution times a factor that depends logarithmically on the strength of non-ideal effects, which means this factor is less than a hundred even in extreme astrophysical situations. Fast Breakup of Magnetic Surfaces Numerical effects allow an unphysical breaking of magnetic surfaces. The extent to which the surface breaking in simulations is due to numerics, rather than physics, and how that effects the reliability of disruption simulations is unknown. The physics of fast magnetic reconnection giving a rapid destruction of tokamak magnetic surfaces is studied in 3 . As shown, an understanding of the physics gives tests for the accuracy of simulation codes and the extent to which inaccuracies affect the reliability of the simulations. In a chaotic magnetic field, the ratio $\\Delta_{max}/\\Delta_{min}$ depends exponentially on the distance a neighboring pair of magnetic field lines are followed. Magnetic field lines that lie in magnetic surfaces cannot be chaotic. Neighboring pairs of lines in a surface or magnetic surfaces have a definite $\\Delta_{max}/\\Delta_{min}$ ratio at any point in time, but that ratio does depend on time. In an ideal evolution, the time dependence of $\\Delta_{max}/\\Delta_{min}$ can be exponential 4 . An ideal evolution that strongly contorts the magnetic surfaces can cause a fast magnetic reconnection no matter how small the non-ideal effects may be. Timescale for Magnetic Reconnection Effects A magnetic field line undergoes a change in topology at a certain instant in time. A sensible definition of a reconnection timescale requires a focus on the physical effects associated with the topology change rather than the topology change itself. Reference 5 shows that $j_{||}/B$ flattens to a constant along each chaotic magnetic field line on the timescale required for a shear Alfv\\'en to propagate along the line. The plasma resistivity and viscosity give diffusion of $j_{||}/B$ across the lines though the effect is generally weak. Simple observational and theoretical considerations imply approximately a hundred toroidal transits are required for a chaotic magnetic field line to go from the central to the edge region of a tokamak plasma. Multi-kilovolt electrons have a mean-free-path greater than a hundred times the distance around the torus, and they spread 5 across the plasma in 10's~$\\mu$s. Both the flattening of $j_{||}/B$ and of the spreading of the spatial distribution of hot electrons produce important effects---a spike in the plasma current, fast changes in the plasma pressure, and heat pulses. In addition, the effects provide a diagnostic for magnetic surface breakup. MathJax.Hub.Config({TeX: {equationNumbers: {autoNumber: \"all\"}}, tex2jax: {inlineMath: [['$','$']]}}); A. H. Boozer.

A variational multiscale (VMS) stabilized FE method with highly scalable multilevel block-preconditioning techniques have been used to perform the simulation in ITER geometry (3D). An initial mesh of about 125K elements and one million unknowns have been used for an initial study. The VDE simulation is started with MHD equilibrium obtained from a Grad-Shafranov solver using real case ITER configuration. An artificial cooling term has been added to model the temperature quench in a disruption. The solver is able to cope with very large velocities triggered by the sudden loss of temperature, as well as the density perturbations. An initial assessment of wall forces and temperatures can be done from the computed wall currents. The simulation solves for (1) the compressible flow (momentum, density, internal energy) and for magnetics (magnetic fields and a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the solenoidal involution).

In this context there are two significant issues that must be addressed for implicit solution of these systems. These are the ill-conditioning of the linear systems that occurs due to the existence of elliptic type operators related to diffusion type process, and hyperbolic type operators that are often generated from off-diagonal cross-coupled transport mechanisms. To handle the elliptic type ill-conditioning optimal scalable multilevel methods are employed. For the cross-coupled multiphysics hyperbolic interactions physics-based (PB) / approximate block preconditioning (ABF) preconditioning approaches are used. These PB/ABF methods reduce the implicit solve for the complex coupled multifluid system into a set of sub-systems that segregate the physics (in the preconditioner only) for which we have demonstrated the use of scalable algebraic multilevel solvers. General details of these approaches can be found in VMS Incompressible MHD , Fully-coupled AMG Resistive MHD , ABF 2D Reduced MHD , Teko PB/ABF Preconditioning Package . As an initial demonstration of the effectiveness of the PB/ABF approach to deal withe the off-diagonal coupling of the Alfven wave we show the solution statistics for increasing Alfven wave CFLs for a preliminary ITER VDE computational after a thermal quench. The table presents the number of time steps (nT), the average number of nonlinear Newton steps per time step (nL/nT), the average number of linear iterations per non-linear step (l,nL) and the average time per time step (t/nT) excluding IO. These preliminary results indicates that the proposed PB/ABF method has excellent algorithmic and time per time step scaling for increasing Alfven wave CFLs.

The model is based on a five moment multifluid model. A specific capability goal is a flexible and extensible capability for modeling complex multiphysics plasmas in the context of proposed tokamak disruption mitigation strategies. The most general multifluid electromagnetic plasma model considered in this project is presented below. This system has a hyperbolic transport/wave physics system sub-structure (Euler-Maxwell) with strong EM, collisional, and ionization/recombination source term coupling, along with the inclusion of 2nd order diffusion type operators (most notably heat transfer). To make this ambitious approach to employing scalable multifluid EM plasma models tractable for TDS, we are building on recent unique algorithmic, and plasma-model developments by our team in the Drekar R&D MHD and multi-fluid/EM code as a software-base. The overall structure of this model is given below. *Five moment general multifluid model for atomic species s with collisional, ionization and recombination terms included and coupled to a full electromagnetic Maxwell system. This model is implemented within the Drekar multiphysics code. Drekar is an implicit/explicit (IMEX) scalable parallel unstructured FE code that employs algebraic flux corrected stabilization methods for handling unresolved gradients and strong shock discontinuities. An illustration of a Two-dimensional diocotron instability \u2013 Analytic growth rate comparison Michael Crockatt(SNL), John Shadid(SNL) Diocotron instabilities 1 2 3 , which are driven by velocity shear in non-neutral electron columns, have been studied experimentally and computationally in beam and cylindrical geometries. We consider a configuration consisting of a cylindrical electron beam inside a uniform axial magnetic field. In this case, a rotational velocity is produced in the plasma column due to $E\\times B$ forces exerted on the electron fluid. A suficiently strong shear in this rotational velocity drives the development of the cylindrical diocotron instability. Because the development of the instability is dominated by $E\\times B$ forces, the electric drift approximation is often used to reduce the electron velocity equation to that of a guiding center model, which removes the cyclotron motion of the particles.

Multifluid growth rate vs mesh resolution Generalized Ohm's law without electron inertia Scalable multilfuid EM solvers based on multiphysics block preconditioning John Shadid (SNL), Edward Phillips (SNL) A critical component of simulating large-scale multifluid systems is our physics-based (PB) / approximate block preconditioning (ABF) preconditioning approaches for complex multiphysics, these methods reduce the implicit solve for the complex coupled multifluid system into a set of sub-systems that segregate the physics (in the preconditioner only) for which we have demonstrated the use of scalable algebraic multilevel solvers. As a demonstration of the scalability of our multifluid simulation capabilities we present an example weak scaling study. This example is for a fully-ionized ion/electron high density/pressure core expanding into a magnetized background ion/electron plasma and the simulations were run on the LANL Trinity machine on > 16,000 cores. Illustration of weak scaling for implicit fully-ionized multifluid plasma model (electrons, ions) for the simulation of an 3D high density/pressure cloud expanding in a lower density background plasma with anisotropic expansion due to the presence of a magnetic field. Multiphysics block preconditioning methods are used to provide a scalable solution in parallel on the Los Alamos Trinity machine. The physics simulation goal is to understand impurity penetration and assimilation into plasmas for proposed disruption mitigation techniques. These techniques currently include massive gas injection and frozen pellet injection. To computationally simulate the proposed type of problems requires robust, accurate and scalable plasma modeling capabilities. We have completed an initial development of a general capability for partially-ionized plasmas composed of multiple atomic species with strongly driven multidimensional hydrodynamic transport processes, collisional, ionization and recombination interactions, and strong coupling to electric and magnetic fields. Neutral cloud expansion in a core region Here we first present an idealization of the process of introducing a high-density neutral species into the core region of a Deuterium plasma at conditions that are representative of Tokamak devices. In this case a 1D simulation is present and the transport is taken to be parallel to the magnetic field direction. Schematic diagram of an idealized insertion of a neutral cloud in the core region for disruption mitigation. Inside the separatrix a high density neutral cloud of Ar ionizes as it expands into a hot (10keV) Deuterium plasma environment. Comparison of expansion of (He, Ne, Ar) neutral cloud in the core region for disruption mitigation at 2.5 micro-seconds. Inside the separatrix the high density neutral cloud ionizes as it expands into a hot (10keV) Deuterium plasma environment. The simulation tracks up to 10 species Deuterium neutral and ion, electrons and the neutral and up to 6 charge states of the inserted species. Massive gas injection Next, we present an idealization of the process of injecting a high-density neutral species from the Tokamak wall into the core region. The jet first expands in the fill tube region, the propagates through a low-density edge/vacuum region, then impacts a static Deuterium plasma core at conditions that are representative of Tokamak devices. In this case a 1D simulation is present and the transport is taken to be perpendicular to the magnetic field direction.

These levels correspond to ~100x, 200x, 400x, 800x the initial D+ nuclei content of the core plasma. Here the number density [1/m^3] is plotted. The problem set up is similar to E. Nardon et. al.

In this context there are two significant issues that must be addressed for implicit solution of these systems. These are the ill-conditioning of the linear systems that occurs due to the existence of elliptic type operators related to diffusion type process, and hyperbolic type operators that are often generated from off-diagonal cross-coupled transport mechanisms. To handle the elliptic type ill-conditioning optimal scalable multilevel methods are employed. For the cross-coupled multiphysics hyperbolic interactions physics-based (PB) / approximate block preconditioning (ABF) preconditioning approaches are used. These PB/ABF methods reduce the implicit solve for the complex coupled multifluid system into a set of sub-systems that segregate the physics (in the preconditioner only) for which we have demonstrated the use of scalable algebraic multilevel solvers.

Overview The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations are continuum models used in the study of a wide range of plasma physics systems, including the evolution of complex plasma dynamics in tokamak disruptions. However, efficient numerical solution methods for MHD are extremely challenging due to disparate time and length scales, strong hyperbolic phenomena, and nonlinearity. Therefore the development of scalable, implicit MHD algorithms and high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement strategies is of considerable importance. We recently developed a high-order stabilized finite-element algorithm 1 for the reduced visco-resistive MHD equations based on MFEM . The scheme is fully implicit, solved with the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method with a physics-based preconditioning strategy. Our preconditioning strategy is a generalization of the physics-based preconditioning methods in [Chacon, et al, JCP 2002] to adaptive, stabilized finite elements. Algebraic multigrid methods are used to invert sub-block operators to achieve scalability. A parallel adaptive mesh refinement scheme with dynamic load-balancing is implemented to efficiently resolve the multi-scale spatial features of the system. The potential of the AMR approach is observed in an island coalescence problem in the high Lundquist-number regime ($\\ge 10^7$) with the successful resolution of plasmoid instabilities and thin current sheets.

In most practical applications, evaluating a Poincar\u00e9 map requires numerical integration of a magnetic field line, a process that can be slow and that cannot be easily accelerated using parallel computations. We propose a novel neural network architecture, the H\u00e9nonNet, and show that it is capable of accurately learning realistic Poincar\u00e9 maps from observations of a conventional field-line-following algorithm. After training, such learned Poincar\u00e9 maps evaluate much faster than the field-line integration method. Moreover, the H\u00e9nonNet architecture exactly reproduces the primary physics constraint imposed on field-line Poincar\u00e9 maps: flux preservation. This structure-preserving property is the consequence of each layer in a H\u00e9nonNet being a symplectic map. We demonstrate empirically that a H\u00e9nonNet can learn to mock the confinement properties of a large magnetic island by using coiled hyperbolic invariant manifolds to produce a sticky chaotic region at the desired island location. This suggests a novel approach to designing magnetic fields with good confinement properties that may be more flexible than ensuring confinement using KAM tori. Paper J. W. Burby, Q. Tang, and R.

We have also briefly explored a long short-term memory network-based approach that uses reduced order model (ROM) and a neural net (DNN) learning process. The method is termed a LSTM-ROM method. This technique employs a 2-stage process. In the first step a set of snapshots from the high-fidelity simulation are used to compute an orthogonal POD basis, from this computation the coefficients of the optimal projection into the ROM subspace can then be computed at each time step for the snapshots. In the second step a DNN is trained to reproduce the time series for the coefficients and auxiliary QoIs such as the growth rate data. From this LSTM-ROM an approximate evolution of the state variables and the QoIs can be obtained. In our preliminary studies for the simple 2D resistive tearing mode, the POD analysis resulted in 3 POD modes being selected for the reduced space. Representative run times for the PDE based simulation for a 2D resistive MHD tearing mode [250 sec. on 72 cores], the LSTM-ROM offline computation [POD: 5 sec., NN training: 50 sec.], and the online [NN ROM computation: 1 sec.] demonstrated significant savings in computational costs.

The so-called Bohm speed regulates the plasma particle and power exhaust fluxes to the wall, and it is commonly deployed as a boundary condition to exclude the sheath region in quasi-neutral plasma modeling. Traditionally, evaluation of Bohm speed from the Bohm criterion are performed in the asymptotic limit and invokes drastic simplification of plasma transport. Here, we drive an expression for the Bohm speed from a set of anisotropic plasma transport equations.

Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. In addressing the modeling and simulation challenges of plasma systems, it is important to account for the fact that uncertainty is endemic to computational simulation of complex multiphysics systems. Numerical simulation of complex multiphysics plasma systems often requires the use of very large-scale computing resources to achieve even marginal accuracy. Thus, we are generally limited to at most O(10 - 50) simulations of the highest fidelity models to approximate the probability distributions propagated through the multiphysics systems and to make predictive inferences. Likewise, experimental, and observational data on complex plasma systems is expensive to obtain, strictly limited in scope and availability, and subject to significant uncertainty and experimental error. Consequently, truly predictive computational analysis and design for these scientific and technology systems requires quantifying the effects of as many sources of uncertainty as feasible. In this study we report on our initial efforts to apply Multifidelity Uncertainty Quantification (MF UQ) to a hierarchy of models and demonstrate the usefulness of a few sampling based MF UQ estimators to improve the precision of statistics for plasma physics problems. Multifidelity approaches recognize that the number of high-fidelity model evaluations will be limited and seek to use many function evaluations from a predictive low-fidelity model to reduce the number of high-fidelity model evaluations required to compute high-fidelity statistics to a specified precision. In this context the high-fidelity model is, e.g., represented as a sum of the low-fidelity model plus a discrepancy term: QHIGH = QLOW + (QHIGH \u2212 QLOW). When the low-fidelity model captures useful trends of the high-fidelity model, then the model discrepancy term, QHIGH \u2212 QLOW, may have either lower complexity or lower variance, and thus requiring less computational effort to resolve its functional form than that required for the original high-fidelity model. Briefly, in the context of the plasma physics systems considered above, we will explore employing a hierarchical approach to defining multifidelity models. We will consider the increasing complexity (and thus computational costs) of these models, roughly ranked as (resistive MHD, extended MHD, multifluid / full-Maxwell, full kinetic PIC). In this way the low-fidelity model would be of lower rank (to the left) and the high-fidelity (to the right). Multilevel Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification (MLUQ). Here we briefly present an initial study of applying multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) sampling in the context of assessing aspects of UQ for a 2D resistive MHD tearing mode problem. The method begins with an inital exploratory log normal sample of a two-dimensional parameter space. The parameters are the viscosity and the resistivity that are used to compute the governing non-dimensional parameters the Reynolds number and the Lundquist number. The initial exploratory sample computes the tearing mode growth rate in the for a sequence of higher-resolution discretizations. The images below visualize the final single island plasma pressure distribution after the breaking of the thin current sheet. The algorithm uses these initial evaluations, or pilot study, to determine the correlation of the models in the hierarchy for the prediction of the QoIs, and also to assess the relative cost on the models. This study uses various mesh resolutions and constant Alfven wave CFL time steps. The result of the MLUQ algorithm/analysis is a development of a sequence of computations, on various mesh levels, that significantly reduces the total CPU time expenditure to achieve a desired level of estimated variance reduction. The table compares the number of simulations scheduled by the MLMC algorithm for each mesh resolution to achieve an estimated standard deviation in the computation of the mean QoI. Clearly, the MLMC algorithm has drastically reduced the number of highest fidelity computations, reducing the overall estimated cost ~30x times to obtain the desired statistical precision. Multifidelity methods for uncertainty quantification (MFUQ) Multifidelity uncertainty quantification allows for efficient and accurate propagation of uncertainty in complex, costly multiphysics plasma models needed to study key features of Tokamak fusion. Initial studies of a model of an expanding core of high-density, fully-ionized plasma into a lower-density, fully-ionized background demonstrated that higher prediction accuracy for quantities of interest can be achieved at a fraction of the cost (~1%) of single-fidelity approaches. The initial plasma state is considered uncertain and characterized probabilistically. Cheaper, lower-fidelity models are generated by employing coarse meshes or low-order numerical methods. Since they can capture basic trends and low-order structure of the response of the quantities of interest (kinetic energy, electromagnetic energy, and particle loss) to the uncertain inputs, these lower-fidelity models can be leveraged heavily to reduce the variance of the mean estimators. Briefly, MFMC corresponds to a multifidelity Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, ACV-MF is a approximate control variate for multifidelity, and ACV-IS is an independent samples strategy. A useful reference for these methods is Generalized ACV for multifidelity UQ . We consider a plasma of ions and electrons with three uncertain parameters -- the core number density, the initial ion temperature, and the ratio of initial electron to initial ion temperatures. Relevant solution profiles for the QoIs at the final simulation time for a representative sample of the uncertain IC. Optimal mean estimators and 99.7% confidence intervals for the QoIs. All MF strategies show significant improvement over a single-fidelity estimator. Reduced sampling UQ and sensitivities for Grad-Shafranov equation. Howard Elman (University of Maryland) The aim of this study is to reduce the computational costs of simulation of a parameter-dependent model of fusion. Using the Grad-Shafranov free boundary problem as an example, for which the solution depends on the intensities of currents going through an array of external coils, we treat the current intensities as stochastic parameters and explore with Monte Carlo simulation how variability of the parameters affects important features of the plasma boundary such as location of the x-point, the strike points, and shaping attributes such as triangularity and elongation. Costs of simulation can be dramatically reduced by replacing the mathematical model, which requires multiple solutions of large nonlinear algebraic system of equations, with a surrogate function built on a sparse grid in parameter space. The use of the surrogate function reduces the time required for the Monte Carlo simulations by factors that range between 7 and over 30. We expect this methodology to be broadly applicable to more complex models. Schematic diagram of the problem domain and solution of the forward problem. The scientific issue is the effect of multiple variations of current intensities on output, explored using Monte Carlo simulation. The mathematical issue is the high cost of repeated solution of nonlinear algebraic equations. Replace \"direct solution\" of algebraic system with surrogate approximation using sparse grid collocation (interpolation). Average CPU times for evaluation of surrogate function and direct solution of the free boundary problem, and cost reductions obtained using surrogates.
