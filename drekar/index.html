<p>Visco-resistive compressible MHD simulation of a Vertical Displacement Event (VDE) during a disruption. A variational multiscale (VMS) stabilized FE method with highly scalable multilevel block-preconditioning techniques have been used to perform the simulation in ITER geometry (3D). An initial mesh of about 125K elements and one million unknowns have been
used for an initial study. The VDE simulation is started with MHD
equilibrium obtained from a Grad-Shafranov solver using real case ITER configuration. An artificial cooling term has been added to model the temperature quench in 
a disruption. The solver is able to cope with very large velocities triggered by the sudden loss of temperature, as well as the density perturbations. 
An initial assessment of wall forces and temperatures can be done from the computed wall currents. The simulation solves for (1) the compressible flow (momentum, density, internal energy)
and for magnetics (magnetic fields and a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the solenoidal involution). Details of aspects of the VMS formulation can be found in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2016.01.019">VMS Incompressible MHD</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2015.04.035">VMS Incompressible FE turbulence model MHD</a>.</p>

<p>A critical component of implicit or IMEX MHD simulations of complex multiphysics systems is the development of scalable preconditioners.
In this context there are two significant issues that must be addressed for implicit solution of these systems.
These are the ill-conditioning of the linear systems that occurs due to the existence of elliptic type operators related to
diffusion type process, and hyperbolic type operators that are often generated from off-diagonal cross-coupled transport mechanisms.
To handle the elliptic type ill-conditioning optimal scalable multilevel methods are employed. For the
cross-coupled multiphysics hyperbolic interactions physics-based (PB) / approximate block preconditioning (ABF) preconditioning approaches
are used. These PB/ABF methods reduce the implicit solve for the complex coupled multifluid system into
a set of sub-systems that segregate the physics (in the preconditioner only) for which we have demonstrated
the use of scalable algebraic multilevel solvers. General details of these approaches can be found in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2016.01.019">VMS Incompressible MHD</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2017.09.028">Fully-coupled AMG Resistive MHD</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/12088879X">ABF 2D Reduced MHD</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1017946">Teko PB/ABF Preconditioning Package</a>.</p>
<p>As an initial demonstration of the effectiveness of the PB/ABF approach
to deal withe the off-diagonal coupling of the Alfven wave we show the solution statistics for increasing Alfven wave CFLs
for a preliminary ITER VDE computational after a thermal quench.</p>

<h3 id="strong-scaling-of-fully-implicit-vms-resistive-mhd-formulation">Strong scaling of fully implicit VMS resistive MHD formulation</h3>
<p>We now consider a heterogeneous geometry consisting of the plasma region ITER geometry as well as the surrounding solid wall. These figures demonstrate the strong scaling of the implementation for two Lundquist numbers $10^4$, $10^7$.
The simulations use a mesh with 346, 272 elements (7.2K poloidal 48 toroidal) and run to 100 global Alfven times with a constant time-step size dt = 2. This results in a max Alfven wave $CFL_A=750$ and max flow $CFL_u ={3}/{2}$. The number of cores is increased from 72 cores to 4680 cores, a 16xâ€€increase. The tests start with around 4800 elements per core with 72 cores, and end with around 300 elements per core with 1152 cores. The strong scaling begins to to become less efficient after approx. 300 elements per core done on 1152 cores. This is to be expected with so little work per core and with increasing cost for communication. The total time to solution, the speedup, efficiency and the iteration count for the solver are all presented. This scaling is excellent for a fully-implicit resistive MHD formulation with 300 elements per processor at the 1152 core case. The linear solver iteration results also demonstrate that the V-cycle coarse grid projection operators and coarse smoothers, and coarse grid solver are working as required as the processor count / sub-domains are increasing. It should be noted that a slightly more expensive smoother was used for the $S=10^7$ case.</p>

<p>Next we have weak scaling plotted in this figure. The weak-scaling tests were done with both a Lundquist number $S = 10^4$  and $S = 10^7$. The time-step size was limited by both a max Alfven wave $CFL_A = 400$ and a max flow $CFL_u = 2.0$ resulting in approximate average time-step sizes of 1.2, 0.55, and 0.25 global Alfven times for the respective mesh sizes. The simulation was run to 50 global Alfven times. The smallest mesh contained 346,272 elements (7.2K poloidal 48 toroidal), with 3,876,048 unknowns and was run on 108 cores. The next mesh contained 2,770,176 elements (28.8K poloidal 96 toroidal), with 30,739,104 unknowns and was run on 864 cores. The largest mesh contained 22,161,408 elements (115.2K poloidal 192 toroidal), with 244,842,048 unknowns and was run on 6912 cores. This weak Scaling shows that the very good scaling of the approximate block multiphysics preconditioner and Schur complement approximations Are capturing the required unresolved fast physics.</p>

<p>Finally, the scaling of the iterative solver with respect to the Lundquist number is shown. The time-step size was limited by a max Alfven wave $CFL_A = 400$ and a max flow $CFF_u= 2$, and was run to 25 global Alfven times, resulting in an average time-step size of $dt =1.2$. The mesh has 346,272 elements, and was run on 896 ARM cores. These results indicates that the fully-implicit formulation and approximate block preconditioners are robust with respect to increasing Lundquist numbers over this large $10^8$ increase.</p>

<p>For the TDS effort Sandia is extending and evaluating a multifluid electromagnetic (EM) plasma model
for simulating collisional partially ionized plasma systems with hydrodynamic and EM interactions that
can be strongly driven and create discontinuities and strong gradients. The model is based on a five
moment multifluid model. A specific capability goal is a flexible and extensible capability for modeling
complex multiphysics plasmas in the context of proposed tokamak disruption mitigation strategies.
The most general multifluid electromagnetic plasma model considered in this project is presented below.
This system has a hyperbolic transport/wave physics system sub-structure (Euler-Maxwell) with
strong EM, collisional, and ionization/recombination source term coupling, along with the inclusion of
2nd order diffusion type operators (most notably heat transfer). To make this ambitious approach to
employing scalable multifluid EM plasma models tractable for TDS, we are building on recent unique
algorithmic, and plasma-model developments by our team in the Drekar R&amp;D MHD and multi-fluid/EM
code as a software-base. The overall structure of this model is given below.</p>

studied experimentally and computationally in beam and cylindrical geometries. We
consider a configuration consisting of a cylindrical electron beam inside a uniform axial magnetic field. In
this case, a rotational velocity is produced in the plasma column due to $E\times B$ forces exerted on the electron
fluid. A suficiently strong shear in this rotational velocity drives the development of the cylindrical diocotron
instability. Because the development of the instability is dominated by $E\times B$ forces, the electric drift
approximation is often used to reduce the electron velocity equation to that of a guiding center model, which
removes the cyclotron motion of the particles.</p>

<p>John Shadid (SNL), Edward Phillips (SNL)</p>
<p>A critical component of simulating large-scale multifluid systems is our
physics-based (PB) / approximate block preconditioning (ABF) preconditioning approaches for complex
multiphysics, these methods reduce the implicit solve for the complex coupled multifluid system into
a set of sub-systems that segregate the physics (in the preconditioner only) for which we have demonstrated
the use of scalable algebraic multilevel solvers. As a demonstration of the scalability of our multifluid
simulation capabilities we present an example weak scaling study. This example is for a fully-ionized
ion/electron high density/pressure core expanding into a magnetized background ion/electron
plasma and the simulations were run on the LANL Trinity machine on &gt; 16,000 cores.</p>

<p>The physics simulation goal is to understand impurity penetration and assimilation into plasmas for proposed disruption
mitigation techniques. These techniques currently include massive gas injection and frozen pellet injection.
To computationally simulate the proposed type of problems requires robust, accurate and
scalable plasma modeling capabilities. We have completed an initial development of a general
capability for partially-ionized plasmas composed of multiple atomic species with strongly driven multidimensional
hydrodynamic transport processes, collisional, ionization and recombination interactions,
and strong coupling to electric and magnetic fields.</p>
