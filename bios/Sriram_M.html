<b>Sriramkrishnan Muralikrishnan</b> is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland. He finished his PhD at the University of Texas at Austin in 2019, where he contributed to the TDS project with fast solvers/preconditioners for high-order HDG methods applied to MHD. In his postdoctoral work he is developing novel noise reduction strategies for particle-in-cell schemes as well as performance portable mini-apps for kinetic plasma simulations targeting exascale architectures. His research interests are mainly in the area of high-order finite element methods, fast solvers/preconditioners, particle-in-cell schemes, plasma physics and large-scale high-performance computing in extreme-scale architectures.
