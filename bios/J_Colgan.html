<b>James Colgan</b> is a Staff Scientist and  the Group Leader in  the Physics and Chemistry of Materials Group in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He has spent much of his career in the fields of atomic & plasma physics, and recently worked on the production of a new generation of opacity tables for the elements hydrogen through zinc. James has broad interests in atomic structure and atomic collision physics and atomic processes in plasmas. Recently he has been involved in calculations of the emission from laser-produced tin plasmas that help in the understanding of the origin of EUV light from such plasmas.
