<b>Hyun-Kyung Chung</b> graduated with a B.E. degree in nuclear
engineering from Seoul National University (Korea) in 1992 and
received a Ph.D at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1998 with a
thesis on the time-dependent collisional-radiative modeling of intense
ion beam-generated argon plasmas. Following postdoctoral work at
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Institute of Theoretical
Atomic and Molecular Physics, on the topic of line broadening of high
pressure sodium vapor, she worked at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in the field of high energy density physics and developed a
time-dependent collisional-radiative code FLYCHK for plasma
spectroscopy. She moved to Vienna (Austria) to work at the
International Atomic Energy Agency to work on international research
collaboration projects for atomic, molecular and plasma-material
interaction data for fusion applications. Since 2019, she works at the
Korea Institute of Fusion Energy in the policy division. Main areas of
her research are studies of atomic processes to understand extreme
plasma states produced in laboratory and astrophysical objects. The
code FLYCHK available at the <a href="https://nlte.nist.gov/FLY/"><b>
NIST atomic spectroscopy website</b></a> is widely used by the plasma
community for spectroscopic analysis with more than 1300 registered
users. She received the 2015 APS-DPP John Dawson Award for Excellence
in Plasma Physics Research.
