<b>Edward Startsev</b> is a Principal Research Physicist in Theory Department at the Princeton University Plasma Physics Laboratory. 
His research interests include: plasma physics and nonlinear phenomena, intense charged particle beams, non-neutral plasmas, plasma turbulence, nonlinear wave propagation, plasma-based acceleration of particles in the laboratory and in space, beam-plasma interaction, high energy density plasmas, atomic and quantum physics, and numerical methods for description of plasmas. He is involved in research in many areas of plasma physics with applications to nuclear fusion (heavy ion inertial fusion and magnetic fusion) and accelerator physics. He is the author and co-author of over 115 publications in refereed journals in the area of beam physics and plasma physics.
