<b>Xianzhu Tang</b> is the Lead PI of the TDS SciDAC Project and the
Director of the TDS Center. He is a theoretical and computational
plasma physicist in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group
in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where
he also serves as the Plasma Physics Team Leader. Xianzhu's research
covers a broad range of issues in plasma physics and interdisciplinary
sciences for fusion energy development, including magnetic
confinement fusion (MCF) and inertial confinement fusion (ICF), as
well as the intermediate regime of magneto-inertial confinement fusion
(MIF).  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xianzhu-Tang-2"><b>
His publications to date</b></a> have advanced the theory and physics
understanding of magnetic and plasma self-organization, chaotic mixing
and dynamo, plasma sheath, dust-plasma interaction, plasma-wall
interaction, radiative power exhaust, particle and energy transport in
open field line plasmas, runaway electron dynamics, and plasma physics
effects of self-generated and externally imposed magnetic fields,
inter-species ion diffusion due to thermodynamic cross terms, and
kinetic modification of fusion reactivity in the mix and burn of an
ICF target. His current research focuses on applying advanced
computing and scientific machine learning/artificial intelligence to
accelerate fusion energy development.
