<b>Daniel Serino</b> is a postdoctoral researcher in Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He received his PhD in Mathematics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in 2019 where he specialized in numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction and free-surface flows. Prior to joining the TDS team, he held research scientist positions in industry  and worked on problems involving acoustic scattering and financial optimization. His current research interests include developing stable numerical discretizations for multi-physics problems, designing long-term stable machine learning architectures for modeling dynamical systems, and developing robust solvers for the free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem.
