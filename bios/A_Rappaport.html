<b>Ari Rappaport</b> spent time at Sandia National Laboratories as both an undergraduate, and graduate student intern. As an undergraduate intern, he worked with Ray Tuminaro on black box multigrid for stationary Stokes and linear elasticity problems. As a graduate student intern he worked with John Shadid, he aided in various infrastructure developments in the Drekar multiphysics finite element package. Notably, the implementation of Schlieren visualization capabilities and machine learning enabled reduced order modeling targeting transient MHD. His principle research project was the development of adjoint based a posteriori error analysis for the stationary resistive MHD equations. Ari received his masters degree in applied mathematics from the University of New Mexico. He is currently a PhD candidate at Inria Paris and Sorbonne Université under the direction of Martin Vohralík and François Févotte. His thesis topic is adaptive linear and nonlinear solvers for nonsmooth and degenerate PDEs.
