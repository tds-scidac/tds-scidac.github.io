He received his PhD in University of Rochester, NY in 2016. Then he had two postdoctoral research periods in UC San Diego and LANL, respectively. In 2021, he started his new career in USTC until present. When he was at LANL, he worked in the TDS team and was in charge of the VPIC particle-in-cell simulations of thermal quench of an open field line plasma, a key thrust in the TDS project. His research interests cover multiple fields of both inertial and magnetic confinement fusion, including laser plasma instabilities, hydrodynamic instabilities, tokamak disruptions, etc.
