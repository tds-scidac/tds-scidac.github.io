<b>Mark Zammit</b> is a Staff Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Mark’s background is in atomic and molecular collision physics, collisional radiative modeling, and opacities. He has developed several general codes, such as the ab initio molecular convergent close-coupling approach for calculating benchmark electron-molecule scattering cross sections, and a suite of codes for calculating molecular opacities of equilibrium and non-equilibrium plasmas. He has also contributed to several other areas, such as the formulation of analytic collision models for particle Monte Carlo plasma simulations and the development of line-broadening theory. He is currently involved in a collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency Atomic and Molecular Data Unit, and notably with colleagues calculated benchmark electron collision cross section data sets for fusion relevant species H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub> and the isotopologues (D<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, DT, T<sub>2</sub>, etc.).
