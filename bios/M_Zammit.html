<b>Mark Zammit</b> is a Staff Scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Markâ€™s background is in atomic and molecular collision physics, collisional radiative modeling, and opacities. He has developed several general codes, such as the ab initio molecular convergent close-coupling approach for calculating benchmark electron-molecule scattering cross sections, and a suite of codes for calculating molecular opacities of equilibrium and non-equilibrium plasmas. He has also contributed to several other areas, such as the formulation of analytic collision models for particle Monte Carlo plasma simulations and the development of line-broadening theory. He is currently involved in a collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency Atomic and Molecular Data Unit, and notably with colleagues calculated benchmark electron collision cross section data sets for fusion relevant species H<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub> and the isotopologues (D<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, DT, T<sub>2</sub>, etc.).
