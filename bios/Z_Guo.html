<b>Zehua Guo</b> earned his PhD in plasma physics from University of California at Irvine, where he studied nonlinear dynamics, wave-particle interactions and turbulence under Prof. Liu Chen. He began his work at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 2009 as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Theoretical Division. From 2012-2018, he was a technical staff member in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group at LANL. His research interest covers a wide range of topics including fluid and kinetic theories, large-scale particle and fluid simulations, machine learning, magnetic and inertial confinement fusion, space plasmas, plasma wall interaction, EM waves, relativistic electrons and disruptions . He currently works at an autonomous driving company to develop SOTA solutions for behavior prediction and planning with ML and DL techniques, while continuing a guest scientist appointment at LANL.
