<b>Oleksii Beznosov</b> is a Postdoctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He received his PhD in mathematics at the University of New Mexico (UNM) in 2020. Before joining the TDS team he did his postdoc at UNM and Cornell studying mathematical and computational aspects of spin dynamics in high energy electron storage rings. His research interests are stochastic particle dynamics in plasma physics and high energy physics, scalable high order numerical methods for wave propagation problems posed on domains with complex geometries, machine learning and high-performance computing. He interests in both mathematical analysis and theoretical physics along with code development.
