<b>Prashant Sharma</b> is a Postdoctoral researcher in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma physics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He is studying the role of charge-exchange process involving high-Z impurity ions relevant in magnetic fusion plasmas. He is working on the collisional-radiative code to extend it to accommodate charge-exchange process and escape of neutrals from magnetic confinement for simulating magnetic fusion plasma. Prashant completed his PhD from the Jawaharlal Nehru University in 2018. He conducted his research at IUAC where he studied the shaking process and its effect on the charge state evolution of the projectile ions near the Coulomb barrier energies. He then moved to Weizmann Institute of Science to work as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Department of Particle Physics & Astrophysics, where he investigated investigated the ionization, rotation, and implosion dynamics of different ion species using the plasma spectroscopy methods and plasma modeling.
