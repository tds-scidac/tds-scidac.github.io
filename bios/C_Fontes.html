<b>Christopher Fontes</b> has been a member of XCP-Division (formerly X-Division) at LANL since 1994. His areas of expertise include the theory and calculation of fundamental atomic physics data (e.g. atomic structure, cross sections, etc.), and their use in plasma kinetics and spectral modeling simulations. He is a primary author of the Los Alamos suite of relativistic modeling codes, which has been developed over the past 30 years to model a wide range of plasmas. Applications include the modeling of low-density (astrophysical), mid-density (magnetic fusion), and high-density (inertial confinement fusion) plasmas under both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and the more challenging non-LTE conditions.
