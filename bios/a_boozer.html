 <a href="https://www.apam.columbia.edu/faculty/allen-boozer"><b>Allen Boozer</b></a> is a professor of Applied Physics at Columbia University and the Institutional PI of the TDS SciDAC Project at Columbia.  His research interests are centered on the fundamental physics and mathematics of non-axisymmetric magnetic confinement of fusion plasmas in both tokamaks and stellarators, and of magnetic reconnection.  He has published 260 articles in referred publications.  His publications have had more than 13,000 citations according to Google Scholar.  Twenty-five have more than a hundred citations each.  He was elected to scientific membership in the German Max Planck Society (Auswärtiges Wissenschafliches Mitglied der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft) (1989), and awarded the Alfvén Prize by the Division of Plasma Physics of the European Physical Society (2010).  Both of these honors were for his contributions to the physics and mathematical foundations of stellarator optimization.  He was also awarded the Kaul prize (2014), the highest scientific award of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.
