 <a href="https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?jnshadi"><b>John Shadid</b></a> is the ASCR PI of the TDS SciDAC Project and the Associate Director of the TDS Center. He is a Distinguished Member of the Technical Staff in the Computational Mathematics Department at Sandia National Laboratories and has an appointment as a National Lab Professor in the Mathematics Department at the University of New Mexico. Dr. Shadid received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Minnesota in 1989. John has contributed to the areas of applied math, numerical methods, computational algorithms, and software development, for solution methods of highly-nonlinear coupled multiple-time-scale PDE systems. John was co-PI for the Aztec software library that received a 1997 R&D100 award and was one of the very first scalable parallel iterative solver libraries. He has also been lead-PI for several projects developing robust, scalable, implicit finite element reacting flow, MHD, and multifluid electromagnetic plasma system simulation capabilities in support of DOE Office of Science oriented scientific applications. In 2018, he was elected as a SIAM Fellow and in 2019 he received the United States Association of Computational Mechanics (USACM) Thomas J.R. Hughes Medal for Computational Fluid Mechanics.
