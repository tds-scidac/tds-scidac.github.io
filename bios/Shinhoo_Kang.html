<b>Shinhoo Kang</b> completed my PhD in Engineering Mechanics (2019) from University of Texas at Austin. Since then, he has been working at the Mathematics and Computer Science (MCS) at Argonne National Laboratory as a postdoctoral Appointee. He focuses on developing stable coupling schemes for Earth System Models. His recent work includes the followings: multirate partitioned Runge-Kutta methods for coupled Navier-Stokes systems; entropy-preserving and entropy-stable relaxation IMEX and multirate time-stepping methods; a scalable exponential-DG approach for nonlinear conservation laws: with application to Burger and Euler equations; and mass-conserving implicit-explicit methods for coupled compressible Navier-Stokes equations. These works are partially supported by Coupling Approaches for Next-Generation Architectures (CANGA) project, which is a joint effort funded by the US DOEâ€™s Office of Science under the SciDAC problem.
