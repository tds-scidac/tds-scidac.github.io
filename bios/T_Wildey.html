<a href="https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CompResearch/templates/insert/profile.cfm?tmwilde"><b>Tim Wildey</b></a> is a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Scientific Machine Learning Department at Sandia National Labs.  He earned his PhD from Colorado State University in 2007 on adjoint-based a posteriori error estimation for coupled multi-physics applications and held the ICES postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Texas at Austin from 2007-2010 working in the Center for Subsurface Modeling on uncertainty quantification, multi-scale discretizations and multi-level preconditioners for coupled flow and mechanics in porous media.  Since joining Sandia in 2011, he has worked on error estimation for surrogate models, physics-compatible and DG discretizations, multi-scale and multi-resolution hybridizable DG methods, Bayesian and data-consistent inversion methods, optimal experimental design, extreme-scale modeling and simulation for multi-scale formulations, developing algorithms for heterogeneous computational architectures, data-compression for memory-bound applications, and uncertainty quantification for scientific machine learning.
