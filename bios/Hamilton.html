<b>Jason Hamilton</b> is a postdoctoral researcher in the Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He received his B.Sc. in Physics and Math from the University of Toronto in 2015, and his Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Cornell University in 2021. He is interested in modeling plasma transport processes in both magnetic & inertial fusion settings as well as basic plasma research, in particular, connecting the physics between kinetic and fluid regimes. To study these problems, during his PhD he furthered the development of the MHD code PERSEUS to incorporate extended MHD effects. He is currently studying transport during a tokamak disruption using the Pixie3D code.
