<b>Weixing Wang</b> is a principal research physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and the Institutional PI of the TDS SciDAC Project at PPPL. 
His professional interests cover theory and computation of plasma micro-instabilities, turbulent 
and collisional plasma transport in magnetic fusion experiments, physics of plasma confinement, 
tokamak disruption modeling, gyrokinetic simulation, and advanced simulation algorithms. 
He is a major architect of several large-scale fusion application codes including 
Gyrokinetic Tokamak Simulation (GTS) code and GTC-NEO. The major focus of Dr. Wang's recent 
research is on tokamam thermal quench dynamics, global turbulence and nonlocal transport, 
plasma flow self-organization, plasma self-driven current generation, and transport barrier formation.
